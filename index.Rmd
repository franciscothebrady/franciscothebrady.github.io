#### Hello!
<br>
<br>

I am currently a student in the Master of Public Policy program at the [Ford School of Public Policy](https://fordschool.umich.edu/)  

~~I am currently a Research Analyst at the UChicago Urban Lab's [Inclusive Economy Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/inclusiveeconomy)~~  

~~I am currently a research assistant in the Real Estate Finance section at the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/rsref-staff.htm).~~  
  
**I'm pretty sure I can say whatever I want when I'm a student**  

~~**None of my opinions represent the views of the federal reserve or any of the reserve banks**~~  

~~**None of my spicier takes represent the sum total of the views of the University of Chicago or Urban Labs**~~  

Research Interests:  
- Public Policy and Economic Research, especially as it pertains to:  
-- inequality  
-- housing
-- urban economics  
-- basic income pilots  
-- open source programming  
-- other cool things
