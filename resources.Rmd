I am a big fan of public goods, and will occasionally put useful things here:  
- [Stack Overflow Profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7448886/francisco): Sometimes smart people answer my questions!  
- [What I based this site on](https://github.com/vonhafften/vonhafften.github.io): Alex is a former coworker, current PhD student at UW-Madison, and all around nice guy.  
- [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/): Weekly newsletter with interesting datasets and researching that comes from it.
