title: "About me"
---

My name is Francisco Brady: 

- I graduated from Howard University with a major in Economics and a minor in Philosophy. I came to Howard for a number of reasons, and it changed my life. I've been a restaurant worker, a retail clerk, and a lot of other things. It took me a while to get here, and I like to think it gives me a different perspective towards what's important in economic research.
